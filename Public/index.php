        <h1>Courses We Offer</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right course is crucial to enjoying your time at university so make sure you really explore your options, even if you think you know what you want to study.

            Your degree course will run for three or more years and your workload will feel much lighter if you genuinely love your course.</p>

                <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                <p>Computer science is about understanding computer systems and networks at a deep level. You will use your understanding of mathematical reasoning to reason rigorously about the behaviours <br>of computer programmes and systems.

                    This course concentrates on creating links between theory and practice,<br> covering a wide variety of software and hardware technologies and their applications.
                    
                    The course offers the <br>opportunity to develop more understanding of Computer Science as a subject, and focuses on the mathematical underpinnings of computer science.<br> It offers the opportunity to gain practical problem-solving and programme design skills.</p>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>UCAS code: G400<br>
                        Entrance requirements: A*AA including Maths, with the A* in Maths, <br>Further Maths or Computer Science.
                        Course duration: 3 years (BA);<br> 4 years (MCompSci)</p>

                <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                <p>Mathematicians have always been fascinated by numbers. One of the most famous problems is Fermat’s Last Theorem:<br>

                    if n≥3, the equation xn+yn=zn has no solutions with x, y, z all nonzero integers.
                    
                    An older problem is to show that one cannot construct a line of length 3√2 with<br> ruler and compass, starting with a unit length.
                    
                    Often the solution to a problem will require you to think outside its original framing. This is true here, and while<br> you will see the second problem solved in your course, the first is far too deep and was famously solved by Andrew Wiles.
                    
                    In applied mathematics we use mathematics to explain phenomena that occur in the real world. You can learn <br>how a leopard gets its spots, explore quantum theory and relativity, or study the mathematics of stock markets.</p>

                <p>UCAS code: G100<br>

                <h3>Economics and Management</h3>
                <p>The Economics and Management degree examines issues central to the world we live in. It namely examines how the <br>economy and organisations function, and how resources are allocated<br> and coordinated to achieve the organisation’s objectives.

                    Economics and Management<br> are ideal intellectual partners, each particularly fitted to strengthen and cross-fertilise the other.</p>

        <h1>Our Campus Tour</h1>
        <p>Oxford University does not organise tours but a city walking tour is offered by the Bodleian Libraries in association with the Oxford Guild of Tour Guides. The tours, all operated by Blue and Green Badge Guides, begin at the beautiful modern Weston Library before heading through the historic and famous streets of the city. Tours take around two hours and can be booked through the Bodleian Libraries.

            A number of independent operators also offer guided tours of Oxford. A range of general and themed tours are available, as are tours by cycle, rickshaw and bus. For a list of tour companies, please visit the Daily Information website.Oxford is not a campus university, so it is not all located on one site. It is made up of many different buildings, including academic departments, colleges and halls, located around the centre of Oxford. Many University buildings, such as gardens, libraries and museums, as well as many of the colleges, are open to visitors during the day, although please note that they may have varying opening hours, fees and rules for groups. </p>

    <h1>What Our Student Says</h1>
    <p>Living and studying in Oxford, one inevitably runs into people with bright, inspiring success stories of those who overcame odds to get here. Yet many students arrive here and find very few, or none at all, compatriots to share their experience with. In this column you’ll be meeting a few of these students, and you’ll be hearing some of their stories and learning a little about their home countries which may not receive the attention they deserve in our national and local media.</p>

        <p>I’ve absolutely loved my first year studying at Oxford! Aside from the excellent teaching, immersive practicals and great resources, Oxford is wonderful place to live and study. First year content is quite broad, including anatomy, histology, embryology, endocrinology, physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry and genetics.The first few lectures can seem a bit daunting compared with A-levels or other pre-university courses, but after a couple of weeks they just fall into place as a part of your (new) normal routine. There are often lectures at the start of a lecture series entitled ‘Introduction to ...’ which can be a great way to get over the initial trepidation surrounding a difficult subject.Anatomy in particular is aided by sessions in the demonstration room, where we look at prosections of specimens to reinforce our learning. We also do practicals using microscopes to observe how cells are arranged in different tissues, as well as more interactive experiments to improve our understanding of physiology and biochemistry. </p>

        <p>Hi! I am a second year medical student at Trinity College Oxford. As I am from Germany, studying medicine at Oxford and in the UK was not the natural choice. Nonetheless, I am so glad I am here - the teaching is great and there are many intriguing people around.

            The pace of the coursework is challenging but with a little time management it’s not impossible to keep up with. Next to coursework, 5-6 times rowing training per week, and going to interesting talks and debates, I still find time to relax and go out with my friends. The thing I like best about the course is the variety of material being taught and how interesting it is. Every week is different and new material is covered, every week you get to know more interesting facts - second year has been especially amazing with regards of this! Learning about diseases and how they come about, looking at bacteria in the lab, learning about neuroscience and how the brain works, and integrating physiological knowledge learned in first year has made every week of second year exciting.</p>
