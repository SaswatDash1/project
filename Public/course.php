        <h1>Courses We Offer</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right course is crucial to enjoying your time at university so make sure you really explore your options, even if you think you know what you want to study.

            Your degree course will run for three or more years and your workload will feel much lighter if you genuinely love your course.</p>

                <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                <p>Computer science is about understanding computer systems and networks at a deep level. You will use your understanding of mathematical reasoning to reason rigorously about the behaviours <br>of computer programmes and systems.

                    This course concentrates on creating links between theory and practice,<br> covering a wide variety of software and hardware technologies and their applications.
                    
                    The course offers the <br>opportunity to develop more understanding of Computer Science as a subject, and focuses on the mathematical underpinnings of computer science.<br> It offers the opportunity to gain practical problem-solving and programme design skills.</p>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>UCAS code: G400<br>
                        Entrance requirements: A*AA including Maths, with the A* in Maths, <br>Further Maths or Computer Science.
                        Course duration: 3 years (BA);<br> 4 years (MCompSci)</p>

                <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                <p>Mathematicians have always been fascinated by numbers. One of the most famous problems is Fermat’s Last Theorem:<br>

                    if n≥3, the equation xn+yn=zn has no solutions with x, y, z all nonzero integers.
                    
                    An older problem is to show that one cannot construct a line of length 3√2 with<br> ruler and compass, starting with a unit length.
                    
                    Often the solution to a problem will require you to think outside its original framing. This is true here, and while<br> you will see the second problem solved in your course, the first is far too deep and was famously solved by Andrew Wiles.
                    
                    In applied mathematics we use mathematics to explain phenomena that occur in the real world. You can learn <br>how a leopard gets its spots, explore quantum theory and relativity, or study the mathematics of stock markets.</p>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>UCAS code: G100<br>

                <h3>Economics and Management</h3>
                <p>The Economics and Management degree examines issues central to the world we live in. It namely examines how the <br>economy and organisations function, and how resources are allocated<br> and coordinated to achieve the organisation’s objectives.

                    Economics and Management<br> are ideal intellectual partners, each particularly fitted to strengthen and cross-fertilise the other.</p>

                            <h3>Chemistry</h3>
                            <p>Chemistry is a wide-ranging science concerned with matter at the atomic and molecular scale. Important aspects are:<br>

                                synthesis<br>
                                structure<br>
                                reaction mechanisms<br>
                                properties
                                analysis
                                and transformations of all types of materials.<br>
                                Chemists are a constant source of innovation: it is hard to imagine any product introduced in recent times that did not <br>require the creative efforts of a chemist.
                                
                                Chemistry underpins the conceptual framework and methodology of biochemistry and molecular medicine and is at the heart of many major industries.</p>
