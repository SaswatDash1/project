            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2025</h2>
            <p>Postgraduate certificates (PG Cert) are taught at the same level as master's degrees, but they are shorter in length. <br>They are ideal for those who wish to advance their knowledge and career prospects but are unable in undertaking significant amounts of academic research. 

                Our postgraduate certificates often attract professionals who wish to advance in their career,<br> and as they are part-time many are able to continue to work full time. They provide an accessible option for students and professionals who wish to build upon previous knowledge and develop new skills. 
                
                Studying a certificate takes less time than a part-time master's and can also be more affordable.
                
                Upon successful completion of a postgraduate certificate, some students have gone on to study a postgraduate diploma <br>or further graduate study at a master's or doctoral level at Oxford and elsewhere.As these are postgraduate courses, you are normally expected to have a good first degree, although in exceptional <br>cases candidates 
                may be admitted on the basis of relevant professional experience.

                We also offer postgraduate diplomas, master's degrees (MSt and MSc) and DPhil programmes.
                
                 </p>
