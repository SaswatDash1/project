                <h1>We are world's one of the largest university</h1>
                <p>Oxford is a world-leading centre of learning, teaching and research and the oldest university 
                    in the English-speaking world.Oxford is a world-leading centre of learning, 
                    teaching and research and the oldest university in the English-speaking world.The 36 colleges and three societies are a core
                     element of the University, to which they are related via a federal system.

                    Each college is independent and self-governing, having a charter approved by the Privy Council, under which it is governed by a Head of House, 
                    elected and appointed by the governing body directly.
                     The governing body comprises a number of Fellows, most of whom also hold University posts.The three societies – Kellogg College, Reuben College and St Cross 
                     College – operate very much like the other colleges but are considered departments of the University rather than independent colleges because, unlike the others, they do not have a royal charter. 
                     One of the main differences is that the governing body recommends a president, who is then appointed by Council.

                     There are also four permanent private halls, which were founded by different Christian denominations, and still retain their religious character today.
